# Lapka PEM SDK for iOS

This library provides high-level interface and abstractions needed in order to use Lapka PEM devices, allowing communication over the headphone jack.

Lapka Personal Environmental Monitor includes four devices:
1. Radiation
2. Organic
3. Humidity
4. EMF

It was used in Lapka and Lapka Pro iOS apps.
